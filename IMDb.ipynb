       "'This is a extremely well-made film. The acting, script and camera-work are all first-rate. The music is good, too, though it is mostly early in the film, when things are still relatively cheery. There are no really superstars in the cast, though several faces will be familiar. The entire cast does an excellent job with the script.<br /><br />But it is hard to watch, because there is no good end to a situation like the one presented. It is now fashionable to blame the British for setting Hindus and Muslims against each other, and then cruelly separating them into two countries. There is some merit in this view, but it\\'s also true that no one forced Hindus and Muslims in the region to mistreat each other as they did around the time of partition. It seems more likely that the British simply saw the tensions between the religions and were clever enough to exploit them to their own ends.<br /><br />The result is that there is much cruelty and inhumanity in the situation and this is very unpleasant to remember and to see on the screen. But it is never painted as a black-and-white case. There is baseness and nobility on both sides, and also the hope for change in the younger generation.<br /><br />There is redemption of a sort, in the end, when Puro has to make a hard choice between a man who has ruined her life, but also truly loved her, and her family which has disowned her, then later come looking for her. But by that point, she has no option that is without great pain for her.<br /><br />This film carries the message that both Muslims and Hindus have their grave faults, and also that both can be dignified and caring people. The reality of partition makes that realisation all the more wrenching, since there can never be real reconciliation across the India/Pakistan border. In that sense, it is similar to \"Mr & Mrs Iyer\".<br /><br />In the end, we were glad to have seen the film, even though the resolution was heartbreaking. If the UK and US could deal with their own histories of racism with this kind of frankness, they would certainly be better off.'"

       " ,xxbos a guy , with the unlikely name of xxmaj shy xxmaj walker , looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half . xxmaj that 's the entire plot ... with across - the - board bad acting , of course . xxmaj walker wanders around a corn maze ( maize ? i get it ! xxup hahaha ... not funny ) and yells \" xxmaj girls ? xxmaj where are you ? ! ? \" about 1000 times . xxmaj for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin , a chipmunk - sounding voice laughs ( as if the pumpkin is laughing at him , yeah xxup ok ... ) . xxmaj his daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream ( maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie ? ) . xxmaj twin girls straight out of ' xxmaj the xxmaj shining ' show up every now and then . xxmaj most of the corn maze looks the same so xxmaj walker 's search gets very old very quickly . xxmaj the filmmakers realize there is xxup nothing going for this movie ( even the music is repetitive ) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast , filming upside down , inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles , using red lights to make the corn look scary , and rotating the camera 360 degrees ( at least i 'm assuming these were done intentionally but it 's likely just examples of incompetent film - making ) . xxmaj more often than not , when xxmaj walker is wandering through the maze , you ca n't see his face . i guess the kid holding the camera ca n't look up that high ... xxmaj this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original ' xxmaj dark xxmaj harvest ' ( which does n't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield ) . xxmaj do n't be fooled by the r rating . xxmaj walker says the f word three times and now we have \" an r - rated horror movie \" , ugh . xxmaj the scarecrow on the cover does n't even show up in this movie ... and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back , you know things are bad ! xxmaj instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around ( unfortunately he is dressed similar to xxmaj mr. xxmaj walker so i did n't even realize he was being followed for a while ) . i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before xxmaj walker did ( the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together , natch ) . xxmaj the end of the movie drags on and on ... and just in case it is n't slow enough , there 's some slow - motion ! xxmaj the last sound you hear ( besides your own laughter ) is very poor sound - dubbing . xxmaj in case you ca n't tell , this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . xxmaj at least they did n't end with the promise of another sequel !,xxbos ... when dubbed into another language . xxmaj let 's face it : xxmaj neither xxmaj nielsen nor xxmaj schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog . xxmaj and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose - loose situation . xxmaj any type of voice - over is sure to be an improvement ( and it actually is - at least in the xxmaj german version ) . \n",

       " ,xxbos a guy , with the unlikely name of xxmaj shy xxmaj walker , looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half . xxmaj that 's the entire plot ... with across - the - board bad acting , of course . xxmaj walker wanders around a corn maze ( maize ? i get it ! xxup hahaha ... not funny ) and yells \" xxmaj girls ? xxmaj where are you ? ! ? \" about 1000 times . xxmaj for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin , a chipmunk - sounding voice laughs ( as if the pumpkin is laughing at him , yeah xxup ok ... ) . xxmaj his daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream ( maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie ? ) . xxmaj twin girls straight out of ' xxmaj the xxmaj shining ' show up every now and then . xxmaj most of the corn maze looks the same so xxmaj walker 's search gets very old very quickly . xxmaj the filmmakers realize there is xxup nothing going for this movie ( even the music is repetitive ) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast , filming upside down , inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles , using red lights to make the corn look scary , and rotating the camera 360 degrees ( at least i 'm assuming these were done intentionally but it 's likely just examples of incompetent film - making ) . xxmaj more often than not , when xxmaj walker is wandering through the maze , you ca n't see his face . i guess the kid holding the camera ca n't look up that high ... xxmaj this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original ' xxmaj dark xxmaj harvest ' ( which does n't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield ) . xxmaj do n't be fooled by the r rating . xxmaj walker says the f word three times and now we have \" an r - rated horror movie \" , ugh . xxmaj the scarecrow on the cover does n't even show up in this movie ... and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back , you know things are bad ! xxmaj instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around ( unfortunately he is dressed similar to xxmaj mr. xxmaj walker so i did n't even realize he was being followed for a while ) . i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before xxmaj walker did ( the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together , natch ) . xxmaj the end of the movie drags on and on ... and just in case it is n't slow enough , there 's some slow - motion ! xxmaj the last sound you hear ( besides your own laughter ) is very poor sound - dubbing . xxmaj in case you ca n't tell , this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . xxmaj at least they did n't end with the promise of another sequel !,xxbos ... when dubbed into another language . xxmaj let 's face it : xxmaj neither xxmaj nielsen nor xxmaj schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog . xxmaj and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose - loose situation . xxmaj any type of voice - over is sure to be an improvement ( and it actually is - at least in the xxmaj german version ) . \n",

' xxmaj aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is xxmaj igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . xxmaj the movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that xxmaj igor escaped from the mental hospital . xxmaj what ? ? ? xxmaj bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this .,xxbos xxmaj an interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . xxmaj even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . xxmaj there are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . xxmaj all up the movie is enjoyable . xxmaj the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , xxmaj norman xxmaj bates is out of an asylum and back to the xxmaj bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . xxmaj perkins plays an aged xxmaj norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he xxunk that spade awfully hard .,xxbos xxmaj this is a bad , bad movie . i 'm an actual fencer : trust me when i say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that . xxmaj this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop . xxmaj the ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish . xxmaj horrible .\n",

       " ,xxbos a guy , with the unlikely name of xxmaj shy xxmaj walker , looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half . xxmaj that 's the entire plot ... with across - the - board bad acting , of course . xxmaj walker wanders around a corn maze ( maize ? i get it ! xxup hahaha ... not funny ) and yells \" xxmaj girls ? xxmaj where are you ? ! ? \" about 1000 times . xxmaj for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin , a chipmunk - sounding voice laughs ( as if the pumpkin is laughing at him , yeah xxup ok ... ) . xxmaj his daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream ( maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie ? ) . xxmaj twin girls straight out of ' xxmaj the xxmaj shining ' show up every now and then . xxmaj most of the corn maze looks the same so xxmaj walker 's search gets very old very quickly . xxmaj the filmmakers realize there is xxup nothing going for this movie ( even the music is repetitive ) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast , filming upside down , inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles , using red lights to make the corn look scary , and rotating the camera 360 degrees ( at least i 'm assuming these were done intentionally but it 's likely just examples of incompetent film - making ) . xxmaj more often than not , when xxmaj walker is wandering through the maze , you ca n't see his face . i guess the kid holding the camera ca n't look up that high ... xxmaj this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original ' xxmaj dark xxmaj harvest ' ( which does n't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield ) . xxmaj do n't be fooled by the r rating . xxmaj walker says the f word three times and now we have \" an r - rated horror movie \" , ugh . xxmaj the scarecrow on the cover does n't even show up in this movie ... and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back , you know things are bad ! xxmaj instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around ( unfortunately he is dressed similar to xxmaj mr. xxmaj walker so i did n't even realize he was being followed for a while ) . i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before xxmaj walker did ( the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together , natch ) . xxmaj the end of the movie drags on and on ... and just in case it is n't slow enough , there 's some slow - motion ! xxmaj the last sound you hear ( besides your own laughter ) is very poor sound - dubbing . xxmaj in case you ca n't tell , this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . xxmaj at least they did n't end with the promise of another sequel !,xxbos ... when dubbed into another language . xxmaj let 's face it : xxmaj neither xxmaj nielsen nor xxmaj schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog . xxmaj and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose - loose situation . xxmaj any type of voice - over is sure to be an improvement ( and it actually is - at least in the xxmaj german version ) . \n",

' xxmaj aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is xxmaj igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . xxmaj the movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that xxmaj igor escaped from the mental hospital . xxmaj what ? ? ? xxmaj bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this .,xxbos xxmaj an interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . xxmaj even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . xxmaj there are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . xxmaj all up the movie is enjoyable . xxmaj the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , xxmaj norman xxmaj bates is out of an asylum and back to the xxmaj bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . xxmaj perkins plays an aged xxmaj norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he xxunk that spade awfully hard .,xxbos xxmaj this is a bad , bad movie . i 'm an actual fencer : trust me when i say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that . xxmaj this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop . xxmaj the ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish . xxmaj horrible .\n",

' xxmaj aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is xxmaj igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . xxmaj the movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that xxmaj igor escaped from the mental hospital . xxmaj what ? ? ? xxmaj bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this .,xxbos xxmaj an interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . xxmaj even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . xxmaj there are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . xxmaj all up the movie is enjoyable . xxmaj the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , xxmaj norman xxmaj bates is out of an asylum and back to the xxmaj bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . xxmaj perkins plays an aged xxmaj norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he xxunk that spade awfully hard .,xxbos xxmaj this is a bad , bad movie . i 'm an actual fencer : trust me when i say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that . xxmaj this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop . xxmaj the ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish . xxmaj horrible .\n",

       "  xxmaj noble efforts by everyone in the production , but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice . xxmaj instead it 's just a lame retread .,xxbos xxmaj first off , the title character is not even the main character of the movie . xxmaj he is the sidekick of the cult leader . xxmaj the actor who portrays xxmaj igor believed that screaming loud , laughing hysterically , and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people . xxmaj igor also had the annoying habit of yelling ( because he never actually just spoke ) in a high pitched voice . xxmaj he would also say idiotic one - liners . xxmaj for example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw , xxmaj igor upon seeing this , yells out \" xxmaj paul ! xxmaj no xxmaj paul ! xxmaj why 'd you do it ? i could have cut her clean ! xxmaj so clean ! \" xxmaj in another scene xxmaj igor tells a victim that she would have to ' get her own tools for surgery because right now , it was his time to operate . ' xxmaj aside from the bad acting , the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax , which is xxmaj igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed , he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining ' good guys ' . xxmaj the movie offers no explanation of this , only telling the viewer that xxmaj igor escaped from the mental hospital . xxmaj what ? ? ? xxmaj bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie . i wish i could get back the moments i lost watching this .,xxbos xxmaj an interesting change from the first one . there was more mystery to this movie then the first . xxmaj even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer . xxmaj there are some good parts through the movie , the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up . xxmaj all up the movie is enjoyable . xxmaj the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film , xxmaj norman xxmaj bates is out of an asylum and back to the xxmaj bates motel , but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother , things start going wrong . xxmaj perkins plays an aged xxmaj norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent , he xxunk that spade awfully hard .,xxbos xxmaj this is a bad , bad movie . i 'm an actual fencer : trust me when i say that this film 's pretension of accuracy is just that . xxmaj this is especially true during that vile little scene when the fencers are combining footwork with 80 's pop . xxmaj the ending is predictable , and the movie is a bore from start to finish . xxmaj horrible .\n",

       " ,xxbos a guy , with the unlikely name of xxmaj shy xxmaj walker , looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half . xxmaj that 's the entire plot ... with across - the - board bad acting , of course . xxmaj walker wanders around a corn maze ( maize ? i get it ! xxup hahaha ... not funny ) and yells \" xxmaj girls ? xxmaj where are you ? ! ? \" about 1000 times . xxmaj for some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin , a chipmunk - sounding voice laughs ( as if the pumpkin is laughing at him , yeah xxup ok ... ) . xxmaj his daughters scream for most of the movie ... even when there is no reason to scream ( maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie ? ) . xxmaj twin girls straight out of ' xxmaj the xxmaj shining ' show up every now and then . xxmaj most of the corn maze looks the same so xxmaj walker 's search gets very old very quickly . xxmaj the filmmakers realize there is xxup nothing going for this movie ( even the music is repetitive ) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast , filming upside down , inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles , using red lights to make the corn look scary , and rotating the camera 360 degrees ( at least i 'm assuming these were done intentionally but it 's likely just examples of incompetent film - making ) . xxmaj more often than not , when xxmaj walker is wandering through the maze , you ca n't see his face . i guess the kid holding the camera ca n't look up that high ... xxmaj this movie gives you a new appreciation for the original ' xxmaj dark xxmaj harvest ' ( which does n't have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield ) . xxmaj do n't be fooled by the r rating . xxmaj walker says the f word three times and now we have \" an r - rated horror movie \" , ugh . xxmaj the scarecrow on the cover does n't even show up in this movie ... and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back , you know things are bad ! xxmaj instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around ( unfortunately he is dressed similar to xxmaj mr. xxmaj walker so i did n't even realize he was being followed for a while ) . i figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before xxmaj walker did ( the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together , natch ) . xxmaj the end of the movie drags on and on ... and just in case it is n't slow enough , there 's some slow - motion ! xxmaj the last sound you hear ( besides your own laughter ) is very poor sound - dubbing . xxmaj in case you ca n't tell , this is the worst movie i 've ever seen . xxmaj at least they did n't end with the promise of another sequel !,xxbos ... when dubbed into another language . xxmaj let 's face it : xxmaj neither xxmaj nielsen nor xxmaj schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialog . xxmaj and given the campy lines they are supposed to utter this is a loose - loose situation . xxmaj any type of voice - over is sure to be an improvement ( and it actually is - at least in the xxmaj german version ) . \n",
